MsgBlockchain Solidity Contract
Overview

MsgBlockchain is a simple Solidity smart contract that allows a contract owner to set and update a message on the blockchain. Other users can reply to the message set by the owner, with certain restrictions to ensure the integrity of the communication.
Features

    Message Setting and Updating: The contract owner can set and update a message.
    Message Reply: Other users can reply to the message, but only if there is a valid message set by the owner and no other user has already replied.
    State Tracking: The contract tracks the number of updates to the message and stores the address of the user who last replied.

Contract Details
Variables

    uint public conter: Tracks the number of times the message has been updated.
    address public owner: Stores the address of the contract owner (the address that deployed the contract).
    address public recipt: Stores the address of the user who last replied to the message.
    string public message: Stores the current message on the blockchain.

Constructor

The constructor is executed once when the contract is deployed and sets the owner to the address that deployed the contract.
Functions

    updMessage(string memory _newMessage) public:
        Owner: Can set or update the message.
        Other Users: Can reply to the message if it has been set by the owner and no other user has already replied. Once replied, the recipt (recipient) is set to the address of the user who replied.

Example Usage

    Deploy the Contract: Deploy the MsgBlockchain contract using Remix or your preferred Solidity development environment.
    Owner Sets a Message: The contract owner calls updMessage with a string argument to set a message.
    User Replies to the Message: A different user (different address) calls updMessage to reply to the message set by the owner.
    View the State: After the message is set or replied to, the current message and the address of the user who replied can be viewed by calling the message and recipt variables.

Example in Solidity

solidity

pragma solidity 0.8.0;

contract MsgBlockchain {
    uint public conter;
    address public owner;
    address public recipt;
    string public message;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function updMessage(string memory _newMessage) public {
        if (msg.sender == owner) {
            // Owner updates the message
            message = _newMessage;
            conter++;
            recipt = address(0); // Reset recipient
        } else {
            // Other user replies to the message
            require(bytes(message).length > 0, "No message to reply to.");
            require(recipt == address(0), "Message has already been replied to.");
            recipt = msg.sender;
            message = _newMessage;
            conter++;
        }
    }
}

Deployment

    Compile the Contract: Use Remix or another Solidity compiler to compile the contract.
    Deploy the Contract: Deploy the compiled contract to an Ethereum testnet or mainnet.
    Interact with the Contract: Use the contract's functions to set and update messages, as described in the Functions section.
